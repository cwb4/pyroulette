PyRoulette
==========

This is my solution to the
`Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design book <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/book/oodesign-python-2.1/html/index.html>`_

I've found the book tanks to the `Hacker Shelf <http://hackershelf.com/browse/>`_,
thanks guys :)

Notes
-----

I really liked the fact the author let you write all the code
yourself, so really you should not be looking at this code :)

Dependencies
------------

* Python3
* `py.test <http://pytest.org/latest/>`_
